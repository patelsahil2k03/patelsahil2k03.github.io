24 Hours. Zero Sleep. One Mission. 🚀

Just returned from the AI-Manthan Hackathon by AtliQ Technologies, and I'm still running on adrenaline and cold coffee! Out of 70+ incredible proposals, Team Innovatrix made it to the Top 10 – and what a journey it's been.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠: We tackled a real-world problem that keeps IT service leaders up at night: 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 – an Operational Risk Early Warning System for IT Projects. The goal? Predict project failures, resource bottlenecks, and budget overruns before they become escalations.

24 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: In one sleepless sprint, alongside GAURAV RATHVA, Dharmendra Mala and Dipendrasinh Mahida we built a production-ready, fully scalable ML-powered platform from scratch featuring:

- Real-time risk prediction dashboards
- Anomaly detection & cost overrun forecasting
- Automated reporting systems
- Enterprise-grade architecture: FastAPI Python backend, Next.js 15 frontend, PostgreSQL with dbt transformations, ML models for predictive analytics, AI insights, and Docker-containerized deployment – all integrated into a seamless monorepo. This wasn't just a prototype. This was enterprise-grade, deployment-ready.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐭 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭: "Technical excellence without business intelligence is just an expensive hobby."

This was my third hackathon, but the first where I truly understood: the code is only half the battle. Understanding the why behind what you're building – the business impact, the stakeholder pain points, the ROI – that's what transforms engineers into problem-solvers.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐖𝐚𝐬 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭: Unlike previous hackathons, we didn't just participate – we executed relentlessly. My team was tireless, motivated, and laser-focused. When you're surrounded by people who refuse to compromise on quality even at 4 AM, magic happens.

𝐊𝐮𝐝𝐨𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐐 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬: For a first-time flagship hackathon, AtliQ absolutely crushed it. From acknowledging every team's effort to providing genuine mentorship, organizing engaging activities, and keeping the energy alive – they set a new standard. Real, accessible, and invested in our success.

Here's to sleepless nights that matter, teams that push boundaries, and solutions that solve real problems. 💡

Team Innovatrix – we built something remarkable. Onwards and upwards! 🎯

🌟 Recognized and Ready for What’s Next 🏆

Had the opportunity to reflect on my journey so far at our first Annual Townhall at Digiflux Technologies Private Limited, where I was honored to receive the Team Star Award.

Over the past nine months, I have worked on multiple projects, contributed to key deliverables, streamlined internal processes, and collaborated with a talented team. From late-night debugging to deploying impactful features, every challenge presented a learning curve and a sense of purpose.

This recognition and shoutout isn’t just about a moment or an award—it’s about the culture we’ve cultivated here. A place where ownership, growth, and collaboration are more than just values—they’re part of the everyday.

Truly grateful to all the colleagues who’ve become mentors, teammates, and friends along the way. And a special thanks to Hemal Pandya Sir and the Digiflux team for consistently enabling a space where learning is encouraged and effort is appreciated.

While this feels like a milestone, it’s only the beginning. Here’s to new challenges, sharper solutions, and more milestones ahead. I’m excited for what’s next!" 🚀

🎓 14th Convocation at CHARUSAT and A Journey to Remember 🎓

On Saturday, January 4th, 2025, I had the privilege of officially graduating and completing my journey of B.Tech Computer Engineering (2020-2024) with 9.35 CGPA as part of the 14th Convocation of Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT). It’s been a rollercoaster of moments—some stressful, many joyful, and all unforgettable. As I reflect on these years, I feel a mix of nostalgia and excitement for the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today.

From the thrill (and chaos) of preparing for exams to countless hours traveling by bus—those rides were filled with unplanned adventures and some of the best conversations. College life wasn’t just about coding marathons, hackathons, lectures, vivas, and practicals, but also bunks, completing attendances, spontaneous food trips, and late-night brainstorming sessions.

Being part of the CHARUSAT football team and staying back for sports and cultural events like Spoural and Vrund added to the vibrant campus experience. Along the way, I found incredible friends who turned ordinary days into unforgettable memories, making college life much more than academics.

My Internship experiences at Larson & Toubro, along with training from Motorola Solutions, writing and publishing research papers, and engaging in innovative projects every semester as part of my curriculum, helped me uncover my potential and inspired me to dream bigger for the future. These opportunities emphasized the significance of continuous learning and innovation beyond the classroom.

CHARUSAT wasn’t just about books and lectures; it was about learning, fun, and the little things that made the journey worthwhile. I am grateful to Chandubhai S. Patel Institute of Technology, CE CSPIT, my faculty, friends, and everyone who contributed to these unforgettable years —thank you for being part of it all.

20CE101 signing off!

Here’s to the next chapter, but always cherish where it all began. Cheers, CHARUSAT! 🎉

As the 3rd week of 2024 has started, let me embrace a small learning step I took and consistently follow for my growth and development.

Beyond coding challenges, it's always about adapting, improving, and accepting change. Coding wasn't my cup of tea and is still testing my abilities but now I am taking a step in the right direction.

Solved Problems for 100+ days in 2023 and got the 100 Days Badge of LeetCode. Competitive coding is more than algorithms; it's a mindset that sharpens problem-solving skills and builds resilience, applicable beyond the screen to real-world scenarios.

Hope amidst every winter, we find an invincible summer awaiting.

Thrilled to share that I have completed the Cloud Engineer Learning Path on Google Cloud Skill Boost as a part of the Google Cloud Career Practitioners Pathway 2022-23(GCCP Campaign) organized by GDSC - Charusat and have received some fantastic swags as well !

Completing this Cloud Engineer Learning Path was a challenging yet rewarding journey.

The program covered a wide range of topics, including Cloud Computing, Cloud Infrastructure, Cloud Storage, and Networking. 

With hands-on exercises and real-world scenarios, I gained practical experience in building and managing Google Cloud resources, designing and implementing cloud solutions, and troubleshooting issues in a cloud environment.

Glad to be a part of Maker Fest Vadodara 2023.

The event was organized by Yuvalay Electronics Lab (renamed as Yuvalay MakerSpace) , Vadodara Innovation Council , co-hosted by the The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda , an initiative of Motwani Jadeja Foundation on 28th and 29th Jan 2023.

It was a wonderful chance to meet makers, innovators, and enthusiasts. Even though I was not an innovator, I volunteered as a content writer in interviewing , analyzing and writing about the different wonderful innovations by the awesome makers. I was fascinated by seeing ideas come to life and meeting people of great feat!

Huge thanks to H. T. Patel sir and Vishakha Laumas for providing and entrusting such an excellent opportunity.

I am also profoundly thankful to KALPIT SHAH for his priceless support in crafting content.

And special thanks to Dr. Ashwin Makwana for constant support.

I am happy to share that I attended the third edition of the Indian Symposium on Machine Learning (IndoML) hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) in collaboration with IIT Kharagpur between 15-17 December 2022.

Through this engagement with leading research groups and experts across the country, I had the chance to learn, gain perspective and get fascinated.

This enhanced my knowledge in the world of ML, network with peers ( Experts, Researchers, and Students), and sought their guidance.

I want to thank the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar for this excellent opportunity. I also want to extend my gratitude to my professors Ritesh Patel, and Dr. Ashwin Makwana who made me aware of this insightful opportunity.

I would also like to thank all speakers for sharing their experiences and talking about their work.

I recently participated in the 'Codepie 2.0' Competitive programming Contest organized by the Faculty of Technology and Engineering in association with CodeChef held on the 14th of October.

This contest taught me so much. I thank my Team members Shail Shah and POOJAN PATEL for such amazing teamwork. From getting TLE errors in all problems to solving half the problems in the contest, we have come a long way. 

Hoping to continue this motivation, be consistent in participating, and do better in the future.

Hackathon projects are great for increasing professional creativity and self-expression by using the most innovative and modern technological solutions. 

Just participation in Hacking Marathon Concept strengthens our networks, connections, collaborations, and innovations while boosting our inspiration, creativity, and productivity.

Recently my team and I participated in Education Department, Govt. of Gujarat organized Hackathon 2022 Regional Round under Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav hosted by CHARUSAT UNIVERSITY. 

Our Problem Statement was Chatbot for GTU. We used RASA for the framework, Flutter for the app, and Firebase for the database, and almost completed the project within the time frame.

Thanks to all the Judges, Coordinators, and other Participants for making this 36-hour-long mega Hackathon an amazing experience.
